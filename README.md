# arqui-riscv

A simple python "simulation" of a two core CPU that implements a small subset of the RISC-V instruction set.
This project was the final assesment for a Computer Architecture course, the focus was on implementing a proper MSI protocol for cache coherence of the
multi core CPU.

Parts of the comments and code are in Spanish.
